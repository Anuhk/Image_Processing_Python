# Image Processing in Python
This space contains my experiments of trying various operations on an image using PIL and OpenCV libraries

# Learnings on PIL

PIL is Python Imaging Library that supports opening,manipulating and saving many different image file formats
PIL offers several standard procedures for image manipulation. These include:
1. per-pixel manipulations
2. masking and transparency handling
3. image filtering, such as blurring, contouring, smoothing, or edge finding
4. image enhancing, such as sharpening, adjusting brightness, contrast or color
 adding text


# Learnings on OpenCV
Opencv is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. Now, it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces

# PIL Vs OpenCV

OpenCV is used for advanced image processing, gives high performance and optimized for real time tasks

PIL is used fro basic image operations, lightweight and not optimized for real time tasks
