This space contains my experiments of trying various operations on an image using PIL and OpenCV libraries

# My learnings on PIL

PIL is Python Imaging Library that supports opening,manipulating and saving many different image file formats
PIL offers several standard procedures for image manipulation. These include:
1. per-pixel manipulations
2. masking and transparency handling
3. image filtering, such as blurring, contouring, smoothing, or edge finding
4. image enhancing, such as sharpening, adjusting brightness, contrast or color
